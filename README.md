# PythonDataOpgave3

Når vi bruger "import datasetter", kan vi tilgå variablen dataset_keys: *datasetter.dataset_keys*  
Den er nemt at indexere dataene efter.

For at være sikker på at have korrekte data, er det en god idé at bruge: *dataset = datasetter.initialize()*
Så kan vi alle bruge variablen "dataset" til at arbejde ud fra.
